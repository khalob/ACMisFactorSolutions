# ACMisFactorSolutions

~ Coding Activity ~

Pick a language that you don't know much about, and write a program that, when given two numbers, tests if a number is a factor of another number. If you'd like a challenge, use one of the following languages: Shakespeare Programming Language, Whitespace, or Lisp. We'll be demoing these at the next meeting, so please put one together!
